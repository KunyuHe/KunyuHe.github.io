> Success comes from standing out, not fitting in.

Hi, this is Kunyu. I recently obtained my Master of Science in [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) from The University of Chicago. Prior to my graduate study, I was an undergraduate student in Economics at Nanjing University.

I'm proficient in machine learning and time series analysis. I have three years of experience with Python and R, two years with SQL, and some exposure to C++. Besides, I'm familiar with Git and Docker. I also have direct experience with AWS.

I'm passionate about applying my quantitative and technical skills in finance. In the past, I interned with the equity derivatives department at [CITIC Securities](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/CITIC_Securities) and [CSC Financial](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/CSC_Financial) as a quant. Before that, I was a data science intern on the Research and Strategy team at [LaSalle Investment Management](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/LaSalle_Investment_Management).
