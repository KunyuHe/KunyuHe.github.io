Hi, this is Kunyu, a machine learning enthusiast.

I'm passionate about applying my quantitative and technical skills in finance. I currently work as an Equity Financing Quantitative Strategist at [Bank of America Merrill Lynch](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/BofA_Securities) in Hong Kong.

I hold a M.S. in [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) from The University of Chicago. Prior to my graduate study, I studied Economics and International Relations at Nanjing University.

I'm proficient in machine learning and time series analysis. I have experience with Python, R, SQL, and C++. Besides, I'm familiar with Git and Docker.

In my spare time, I love following League of Legends Esports and Formula One. Recently, I've been playing [Dead by Daylight](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dead_by_Daylight), [Monster Hunter: World](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Monster_Hunter:_World), and [Hitman 2](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hitman_2_(2018_video_game)) quite often. For TV Series, I love [Mad Men](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mad_Men) and [Breaking Bad](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Breaking_Bad). Besides, I had some experience singing on stage during my undergrad and I enjoyed it quite a lot.
