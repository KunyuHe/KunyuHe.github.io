> Success comes from standing out, not fitting in.

Hi, this is Kunyu. I'm originally from mainland China and have studied in the United States. Currently, I reside in Hong Kong.

I hold an M.S. in [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) from The University of Chicago. Prior to my graduate studies, I pursued Economics and International Relations at Nanjing University.

Professionally, I am passionate about applying my quantitative and technical skills in finance. My expertise lies in data analysis and statistical modeling, with proficiency in Python and SQL. I currently work as an Equity Swap Trader at [Bank of America Merrill Lynch](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/BofA_Securities) in Hong Kong.

In my spare time, I love following film commentary and watching Formula One. My favorite TV series include [Mad Men](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mad_Men) and [Breaking Bad](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Breaking_Bad). Additionally, I had the opportunity to perform on stage for singing during my undergraduate years, and it has been a joyful experience for me ever since.
